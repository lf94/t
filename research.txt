CPL is Characters Per Line. Why does this matter? Because your eyes lose focus on lines that are too long. The optimal range is 50-75 cpl. tyreese used to use the average, 66 cpl, but has given that up because resizing the editor window is necessary for some code bases. Luckily, most code is written at 80 CPL or less.
